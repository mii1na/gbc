# COMP1238 - Study Notes  

## Week 1 - History of Writing  
- Early humans used **cave paintings** (~30,000 years ago) to communicate.  
- The **Ishango bone** (~20,000 years ago) had tally marks, maybe for counting.  
- The first real **writing system** was **cuneiform** (~5,000 years ago) on clay tablets.  
- Writing was mainly for **keeping records** (like food and trade).  

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes  
- Computers store data using **binary (0s and 1s)**.  
- **1 byte = 8 bits**; text is stored using **ASCII** (e.g., 65 = 'A').  
- **RAM is volatile** (loses data when off), while **SSDs/HDDs are non-volatile**.  
- Computers use **binary (Base 2), decimal (Base 10), and hexadecimal (Base 16)**.  

## Week 3 - Structure of Text  
- **Markdown** is a simple way to format text (`# Heading`, `**bold**`, `- list`).  
- **HTML** structures web content with tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`).  
- **JSON** stores structured data with key-value pairs (`{"name": "Alice"}`).  
- **Unicode (UTF-8)** supports more characters than ASCII.  
- **GitHub uses Markdown** for README files and documentation.  

## Week 4 - Manipulating Text & Text Editors  
- **Touch typing** is important for speed and efficiency.  
- **VS Code** is a popular text editor; **Vim** is for advanced users.  
- **Ctrl + F** is useful for searching; **regex** helps with patterns (`line\d+`).  
- **GitHub Pages** lets you host websites from a repository.  
- **Version control** (Git) helps manage changes in projects.  

## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces (CLI)  
- **CLI is faster** than GUIs for many tasks.  
- **Basic commands:** `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `pwd` (show path).  
- **Advanced commands:** `grep` (search text), redirection (`>`), and piping (`|`).  
- **SSH** is used for secure remote access; `scp` and `sftp` for file transfers.  
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** lets you run Linux commands on Windows.  

## Week 6 - Git, GitHub, Diff, and Versioning  
- **Git** is for tracking changes locally, **GitHub** stores projects online.  
- **Basic workflow:** `clone`, `pull`, `modify`, `commit`, `push`.  
- **Diff** shows file differences; **patch files** apply updates.  
- **Branching** helps with separate work; merge conflicts happen when changes overlap.  
- **Good habits:** Commit often, write clear messages, and collaborate with others.
